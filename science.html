<p>These are the science stream career options after 10th!
Science stream is a very common choice among 10th standard passed students in India. Students who want to pursue applied and pure science professional courses in the future may choose this stream. There are a variety of boards in India, subjects to study, professional courses available, prospects, and science stream career options after 10th which can be chosen according to each one’s convenience.</p>
<br>
<p>The Science stream is a bit challenging when compared to all the other main streams like Arts and Commerce. Academically talented students won’t have much difficulty in facing the subjects present in this stream. </p>
<br>
<b>Science Stream Boards Available In India</b>
<br>
<p>There are four important education boards available in India. Students can choose a stream that suits them the best. The choice should be made based on the basis of the aptitude of the student and the difficulty level associated with the boards.</p>
<br>
<b>CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)</b>
<br>
<b>ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)</b>
<br>
<b>IB (International Baccalaureate)
State Boards</b>
<br>
<p>IB is the hardest board among the above mentioned ones. It is laid on the ‘practical aspects’ and ‘application knowledge’ of learning.</p> 
<br>
<p>When it comes to the level of difficulty, IB is followed by the ICSE board. Then comes the CBSE board which is almost known by everyone and it functions under the Union Government of India. The level of difficulty associated with this board is moderate.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, comes the State Boards which function under the respective state governments of each state. The medium of instruction in the case of schools affiliated with such boards is English and regional language.</p>
<br>
<b>Science Stream Groups</b>
<br>
<p>There are two main groups within it when it comes to the science stream. They are - </p>
<br>
<b>Mathematics Group (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as main subjects)</b>
<br>
<b>Biology Group (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry as main subjects)</b>
<br>
<p>These groups end up determining the career path of a student to an extent. A student may pursue both of them at the same time or may choose any of the above mentioned groups. The choice can be taken according to each one’s abilities. </p>
<br>
<p>The biology group is generally known as the B group and the mathematics group is generally known as the A group. Students pursuing both groups may assume themselves as AB group students.</p>

<b>Evaluation and Academic Program</b>
<br>
<p>There are two academic years present which are 12th and 11th standards. In the case of state boards and the other boards, each academic year gets divided into two semesters with each one lasting for a period of 6 months. Main evaluation exams are conducted at the end of each academic year in the case of a semester learning system.</p> 
<br>
<b>Professional Courses After 12th Science</b>
<br>
<p>saaProfessional courses available in science stream career options after 10th can be roughly classified into three types such as pure science courses, applied science courses, and other courses. Such courses are available in Bachelor’s Degree and in Diploma formats.</p>
<br>
<p>Course selection is influenced by the group a student has had in 12th and 11th classes. Some of the well known professional courses available based on those groups are -</p>
